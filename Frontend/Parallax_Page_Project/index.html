        Thankyou for showing interest, here is a quick story of me. My
        Programming journey started back in 2018, after I started studiying
        Bachelor of Technology in Information Technology at University College
        of Engineering , BIT Campus, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India. I like
        coding all kind of problems from the very basic like adding numbers to
        the complex ones like competitive programming problems. I love making
        projects. Infact this website is one of my Web Development Projects
        which is built using HTML and CSS.<br /><br />Language known : HTML,
        CSS, JAVASCRIPT.<br />
        IT Constructs : SASS, BOOTSTRAP, and GIT & GITHUB.
